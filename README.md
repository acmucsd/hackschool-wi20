# Project Part 1: Making the HTML/CSS Front-End Structure of Our Application
Project Information for Part 1.

For this section of the project, we are going to be designing each of the front-end components we need for the project in HTML & CSS.  
  
The starter code is located in the *htmlStructure* folder, with the solution code in the *htmlStructureSolution* folder. We recommend you work off the *htmlStructure* folder and look at the solution code at the end. 

Each of the following files has TODOs inside of them. We recommed you visit each file in the following order:
  - htmlStructure/index.html
  - htmlStructure/main.css
  - htmlStructure/gallery.html
  
Let us know if you have any questions regarding any of the tasks assigned. We recommend using the slides as a guideline when you are stuck.
